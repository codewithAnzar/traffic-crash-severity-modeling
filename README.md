# Statistical Modeling of Traffic Crash Severity

## Project Overview
This project applies logistic regression to classify high vs low traffic crash severity using U.S. state-level crash data.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Engineer a binary severity classification variable
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate performance using classification metrics

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Logistic regression modeling
4. Confusion matrix and classification report analysis

## Results
The model demonstrates how statistical learning methods can be used to identify patterns in crash severity data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Future Improvements
- Cross-validation
- Feature scaling experiments
- Comparison with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
